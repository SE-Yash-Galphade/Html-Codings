            The living <strong>angel</strong> in our <br>life who easily handles<br> everything in the house and also takes 
            care of us is our mother. <br>She is probably one of <i>those</i> few people who<br> I can blindly trust.
            as many <q>say that mothers</q> are the <em>supreme</em> <u>creation</u> of God, for <i>they</i> a bit of God in
            themselves.
